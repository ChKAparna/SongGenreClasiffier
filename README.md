# SongGenreClasiffier
Classifying music genres based on data analysis without actually listening to the songs.
In doing so, I do the following:
  1.clean the data
  2.exploratory data visualization of the data
  3.feature reduction (Correlation and Principal Component Analysis)
  4.use ML algorithms like decision trees and logistic regression
